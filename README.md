Huffman-Algorithm-Implementation

This is a Python based project to implement the Huffman Algorithm. Huffman algorithm is an encoding used to compress files. It is based on frequency of occurence of each character. In this project, I have demonstrated the working of the algorithm for text files.
To run the code:
 Clone and download the zip file.
